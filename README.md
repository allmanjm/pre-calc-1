# PreCalcSkills1

This is a bank of randomized exercises for the CheckIt platform. The exercises align with learning outcomes for specific precalculus skills which, in the opinion of the bank's author, are "must have" skills for doing differential single\-variable calculus (with algebraic functions).

The exercises were developed originally for the first semester of a year-long "Calculus I with Integrated Precalculus" sequence at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, NC [<https://math.wfu.edu/>]. 

The learning outcomes in this Precalculus Skills bank directly support the learning outcomes in the Differential Calculus of Algebraic Functions bank found at the links below:

## Learning Outcomes for PreCalcSkills1

###### PTL. Top level operations for expressions.

 - PTL1. I can recognize the <em>top level operation</em> in an algebraic expression [Sum/Difference, Product/Quotient, or Composition].

###### PER. Exponent rules.

 - PER1. I can manipulate expressions with exponents and common bases.
 - PER2. I can do arithmetic with rational exponents.

###### PFa. Factoring (turning a sum/difference into a product/quotient).

 - PFa1: I can factor quadratic expressions over the rational numbers.
 - PFa2: I can factor out common terms from a sum to obtain a product of irreducibles.

###### PEx. Expanding (turning a product into sum/difference).

 - PEx1: I can use “FOIL” or Pascal’s Triangle to expand binomials raised to whole number powers.
 - PEx2: I can expand products with factors beyond binomials.

###### PCa. Cancellation rules.

 - PCa1. I can correctly identify and perform additive and/or multiplicative cancellations (*additive* means the canceled terms are replaced with “plus 0”; *multiplicative* means the canceled factors are replaced with “times 1”).

###### PPQ. Analyzing expressions that are products/quotients.

 - PPQ1. I can determine when a product/quotient is zero and undefined.
 - PPQ2. I can use a <em>sign chart</em> to determine when a product/quotient is positive and/or negative.

###### PBL. Basic library of functions, equations, and graphs/sketches.

 - PBL1. I can write an equation and sketch a graph for a line determined either by (1) two points, or (2) one point and a slope.
 - PBL2. I can determine when a quadratic expression has 0, 1, or 2 real roots using both algebra and graphing.
 - PBL3. I can determine the domain of an algebraic function.

#### Definitions of italicized terms in learning outcomes

1. The _top level operation_ of an algebraic expression is the final operation one would perform if evaluating the expression in **Reverse Polish Notation** \[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse\_Polish\_notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)\]. This may not be the best way to explain the idea to students, but it's the definition I've used to build the exercises.

> Students need to recognize top level operations in order to correctly apply differentiation rules later in calculus. In particular, I noticed that many of my students had difficulty recognizing the difference between products and compositions, especially those involving transcendental functions.

2. A *sign chart* for a function $f(x)$ of one variable, which is continuous on its domain, is a number line decorated with 

 - tickmarks at each isolated zero and pole;
 - $+$ signs decorating the intervals (between tickmarks) where $f(x)>0$;
 - $-$ signs decorating the intervals (between tickmarks) where $f(x)<0$.

> Typically, students learn to make sign charts for first and second derivatives so they can determine where functions are increasing/decreasing or concave up/down. This is a good enough reason to include their construction as a learning objective. But, sign charts are also useful in their own right; they can help students decide when the graph of a function is above or below the $x$-axis, help them sort out limits where the answer is $\pm \infty$ OR "does not exist", and are generally a good way to solve inequalities!
