For the following expression,
        </p>
<list>
    <item> <p>identify the greatest common factor (aka GCF), and</p></item>
    <item> <p>use the GCF to factor the expression into irreducible factors.</p></item>
</list>
        <p>
<m mode="display"> 
{{c0}}\,{{mono}}\,\left({{binom}}\right)^{ {{binomP}} } \, \left[ {{trans}} \right]^{ 2 } +
    {{c1}}\,{{mono_s}}\,\left({{binom}}\right)^{ {{binomP_s}} }\,{{trans}}
</m>
Prove and demonstrate that your answer is correct by using the distributive property to re-expand it.
